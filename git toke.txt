1. git init

3. git add <file_name> or git add .

3. git commit -m <Message_text> 

4. git push origin main   #if case you're in main branch 
   git push origin master #if case you're in Master branch



5. git clone <URL>
      ex: git clone https://github.com/Jagan-18/DAWS_76s_P.git

Note: Above push repo issue we need to following this step's

1. Check if the remote is configured: 
 
- git remote -v

You should now see output like this:
-----------------------------------
-  origin  https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git (fetch)
- origin  https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git (push)

2. If missing, add the remote: git remote add origin <repository-url>
3. Push to the remote: git push origin master

 git add . ; git commit -m "roboshop shell script"; git push origin master


git clone -b master https://github.com/Jagan-18/DAWS_76s_P.git
