# Basics of CI/CD

## What is CI/CD?

- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Automating the process of integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository several times a day.
- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment):** Automating the release of integrated code to production or staging environments.

## Key Concepts

- **Version Control:** Centralized codebase (e.g., Git).
- **Automated Builds:** Code is compiled and built automatically.
- **Automated Testing:** Tests run automatically to catch issues early.
- **Deployment Automation:** Code is deployed to environments without manual intervention.

## Benefits

- Faster development cycles
- Early bug detection
- Reliable and repeatable deployments
- Improved collaboration

## Typical CI/CD Pipeline Steps

1. **Code Commit:** Developers push code to repository.
2. **Build:** Automated build process starts.
3. **Test:** Automated tests are executed.
4. **Deploy:** Code is deployed to staging/production.
