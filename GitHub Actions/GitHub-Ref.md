# GitHub Actions - Complete Theory Notes (Beginner to Advanced)

## 🔰 1. Introduction to GitHub Actions

### ✅ What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is an **automation platform** built into GitHub that helps you automate software workflows such as building, testing, and deploying your code.

### 💡 Why is it Important?

* Automates repetitive tasks (CI/CD)
* Ensures consistency in builds and deployments
* Saves time and reduces human error
* Integrated directly into GitHub repositories

### 🛠️ How It Works:

1. You define workflows in YAML files.
2. These workflows run based on triggers like code pushes or pull requests.
3. Each workflow has jobs made of steps.
4. Steps can run scripts or reusable actions.

### 📦 Real-world DevOps Use Case:

* Automatically test code on every commit.
* Deploy code to staging/production after merging PRs.

---

## 🧠 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Workflow

* **Definition**: A set of instructions written in YAML that defines when and what to execute.
* **Location**: `.github/workflows/`
* **Structure**:

  * Trigger (`on:`)
  * Jobs (`jobs:`)
  * Steps inside each job

### 2.2 Job

* **Definition**: A group of steps that run on the same runner.
* **Execution**: Jobs can run sequentially or in parallel.
* **Runner**: VM or container that executes the job.

### 2.3 Step

* **Definition**: A single task within a job (e.g., run script, checkout code).
* **Execution**: Steps run in order and share environment.

### 2.4 Action

* **Definition**: A reusable component to perform a task (e.g., checkout code, set up Node.js).
* **Usage**: Declared using `uses:` in a step.

## 🚀 3. Triggering Workflows

### ✅ `on:` Keyword

Defines when the workflow should run.

#### Common Triggers:

* `push`
* `pull_request`
* `schedule` (CRON)
* `workflow_dispatch` (manual)

---

## 🖥️ 4. Runners

### ✅ What is a Runner?

A virtual environment where the job is executed.

### Types:

* **GitHub-hosted**: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
* **Self-hosted**: Your own servers or machines

### Runner Selection:

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

---

## 📂 5. File Structure

```
your-repo/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── main.yml  ← Workflow YAML file
```

---

## 🧪 6. Real-World CI/CD Flow (Theory)

### Example: Web App Deployment

* **Trigger**: `push` to `main`
* **Jobs**:

  1. Checkout Code
  2. Install Dependencies
  3. Run Tests
  4. Build Artifact
  5. Deploy to Server

### Benefits:

* Automated testing & deployment
* Fewer manual errors
* Fast feedback loops

---

## 🔐 7. Secrets and Environment Variables

### ✅ What are Secrets?

Sensitive data (e.g., API keys, tokens) stored securely.

### Usage:

* Set in GitHub repo under Settings → Secrets
* Access in workflow via `secrets.<NAME>`

```yaml
env:
  API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MY_API_KEY }}
```

---

## ⚙️ 8. Matrix Builds

### ✅ What is a Matrix Build?

Run tests across multiple environments (e.g., Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9).

### Example:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: [3.7, 3.8, 3.9]
```

---

## 📦 9. Artifacts

### ✅ What are Artifacts?

Files or results (e.g., test reports, build outputs) saved after a job runs.

### Usage:

* `actions/upload-artifact`
* `actions/download-artifact`

---

## 🚄 10. Caching

### ✅ Purpose:

Speed up workflows by caching dependencies.

### Example:

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

---

## ♻️ 11. Reusable Workflows

### ✅ What is it?

A workflow that can be called from other workflows.

### Example:

```yaml
jobs:
  call-workflow:
    uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/build.yml@main
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 12. Manual Triggers

### ✅ `workflow_dispatch`

Used for manually running workflows.

### Example:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Deploy Environment'
        required: true
```

---

## 🌐 13. Environment-specific Deployments

### ✅ Purpose:

Deploy to different targets based on environment.

### Example:

```yaml
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

---

## 🛡️ 14. Security Best Practices

* Never hardcode secrets
* Use least-privilege principles for tokens
* Limit workflow scope and permissions

---

# GitHub Actions - Complete Theory Notes (Beginner to Advanced)

## 🔰 1. Introduction to GitHub Actions

### ✅ What it is:

GitHub Actions is an **automation platform** built into GitHub that helps you automate workflows like building, testing, and deploying your code based on triggers such as pushing code or opening pull requests.

### 💡 Why it matters:

* Automates repetitive tasks (like CI/CD)
* Reduces human error and manual effort
* Ensures consistent delivery pipelines
* Integrated directly into GitHub

### ⚙️ How it works (in simple terms):

* You define a YAML file (`.yml`) inside `.github/workflows/`
* This file describes what should happen, when, and how
* GitHub runs your steps on a virtual machine (runner) when triggered

### 📦 Example (theory-focused):

Think of GitHub Actions as a robot inside your repo. You give it instructions (workflows), and it follows them every time you make changes.
---
## 🧠 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 ✅ Workflow
**What it is:**
A **workflow** is the main YAML file that defines what should happen and when.

**Why it matters:**
It acts as the brain of your automation. All GitHub Action logic is written inside a workflow.

**How it works (in simple terms):**

* Stored in `.github/workflows/your-workflow.yml`
* Starts with a trigger (`on:`)
* Contains one or more jobs

**Example (theory-focused):**
A recipe book. Each recipe is a workflow—it defines what ingredients (jobs) are needed and the steps to prepare it.

---

### 2.2 ✅ Job

**What it is:**
A **job** is a set of steps that run on the same machine (runner).

**Why it matters:**
Jobs break down workflows into logical sections. Each job runs in isolation and can be parallel or dependent.

**How it works (in simple terms):**

* Jobs run on virtual machines or containers
* You can run jobs in parallel or in sequence using `needs:`

**Example (theory-focused):**
In an assembly line, one job does packaging, another does labeling. Each has a specific task.

---

### 2.3 ✅ Step

**What it is:**
A **step** is an individual task inside a job.

**Why it matters:**
This is where commands are executed, such as running tests or installing software.

**How it works (in simple terms):**
Steps are listed inside jobs and executed in order.

**Example (theory-focused):**
If a job is "make tea", steps are: boil water, add tea leaves, strain, serve.

---

### 2.4 ✅ Action

**What it is:**
An **action** is a reusable task or plugin that can be used in a step.

**Why it matters:**
Actions help avoid repeating code. Use community or custom-built actions.

**How it works (in simple terms):**
You can use actions with `uses:` like `uses: actions/checkout@v3`

**Example (theory-focused):**
Instead of writing your own "open browser" command every time, you just reuse a prebuilt open-browser tool.

---

## 🚀 3. Triggers (`on:`)

**What it is:**
Defines the event that will start the workflow.

**Why it matters:**
Controls automation—when should things run?

**How it works (in simple terms):**
Declared at the top of the YAML file. Common values:

* `push`
* `pull_request`
* `schedule`
* `workflow_dispatch`

**Example (theory-focused):**
A workflow runs when you push to `main`, or you manually trigger it from the UI.

---

## 🖥️ 4. Runners

**What it is:**
The machine (virtual or self-hosted) that executes your jobs.

**Why it matters:**
Your jobs and steps run on these runners. Choice affects performance, speed, and cost.

**How it works (in simple terms):**
GitHub provides runners (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS). You can also host your own.

**Example (theory-focused):**
Imagine a construction site. The worker (runner) follows your blueprint (workflow).

---

## 🔐 5. Secrets and Environment Variables

**What it is:**
Secure way to store sensitive data like tokens or passwords.

**Why it matters:**
You never want secrets in plain text in code.

**How it works (in simple terms):**
Defined in GitHub → Settings → Secrets. Used in YAML as `${{ secrets.YOUR_SECRET }}`

**Example (theory-focused):**
Instead of writing your database password in code, GitHub securely injects it.

---

## ⚙️ 6. Matrix Builds

**What it is:**
Allows running the same job with different parameters (e.g., Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9).

**Why it matters:**
You can test your code in multiple environments automatically.

**How it works (in simple terms):**
Use `strategy.matrix` to define combinations.

**Example (theory-focused):**
Like testing a car with petrol, diesel, and electric engines to ensure compatibility.

---

## 📦 7. Artifacts

**What it is:**
Files generated during a workflow that you want to save (e.g., test reports, build outputs).

**Why it matters:**
Artifacts help in debugging or deployment. You can download them later.

**How it works (in simple terms):**
Use `upload-artifact` and `download-artifact` actions.

**Example (theory-focused):**
You run tests and store the report so others can review it.

---

## 🚄 8. Caching

**What it is:**
Store and reuse dependencies between runs.

**Why it matters:**
Speeds up workflow execution by avoiding repeated downloads.

**How it works (in simple terms):**
Use the `actions/cache` action with key & path.

**Example (theory-focused):**
Like saving your cooking ingredients instead of buying them each time.

---

## ♻️ 9. Reusable Workflows

**What it is:**
A way to create and reuse standard workflows in multiple repositories.

**Why it matters:**
DRY principle—don’t repeat yourself.

**How it works (in simple terms):**
Use `uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/filename.yml@main`

**Example (theory-focused):**
Like a shared SOP document that teams reuse instead of rewriting steps.

---

## 🧑‍💻 10. Manual Triggers (`workflow_dispatch`)

**What it is:**
Let you manually run a workflow via GitHub UI.

**Why it matters:**
Useful for deployments or ad-hoc operations.

**How it works (in simple terms):**
Include `on: workflow_dispatch` and optional input parameters.

**Example (theory-focused):**
Like pressing a button to launch a build or deploy.

---

## 🌐 11. Environment-specific Deployments

**What it is:**
Define stages like dev, staging, production.

**Why it matters:**
Improves control and reduces risk.

**How it works (in simple terms):**
Use `environments:` and conditionals like `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`

**Example (theory-focused):**
Only deploy to prod if code is merged to the `main` branch.

---

## 🛡️ 12. Security Best Practices

* Use `secrets` instead of plain text variables
* Use fine-grained PATs (personal access tokens)
* Pin action versions (e.g., `@v3`) to avoid breaking changes
* Restrict environments and protect main branches

---

## 🏁 13. Summary

GitHub Actions gives you the power to automate testing, builds, and deployments. Once you understand its concepts—like workflows, jobs, steps, actions—you can create powerful CI/CD pipelines that save time and reduce errors.

### ✅ What You Can Do:

* Run tests automatically on every push
* Build Docker images and push to registries
* Deploy to AWS, Azure, or Kubernetes clusters
* Schedule security scans or cleanup tasks

With a strong theoretical foundation, you're now ready to implement real-world DevOps workflows using GitHub Actions.
